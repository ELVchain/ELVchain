Entity Link Value Blockchain(ELV) is a secure and reliable financial-grade open-source blockchain platform led by Elv Team. Its performance has reached over 100,000 TPS with single-chain setup. The platform provides rich features including group architecture, cross-chain communication protocols, pluggable consensus mechanisms, privacy protection algorithms, advanced cryptography algorithms, and distributed storage. Its performance, usability, and security wil be testified by many users and DeApps in the coming future.

This is a concept of prototype. For the final version, please follow this project which is planned to be published in the Elv v2.0. 

### Group Architecture
Using SCN, multi- onsensus algorithm and side chain, our group architecture is designed to allow the simultaneous management of multiple ledger groups in the same blockchain network to facilitate speedy ledger setup and support massive service requests. This innovative architecture supports better scalability with key designs including inter-group transaction processing, distributed data storage, and intra-group consensus isolation. It aims to effectively scale up the business and simplify toilsome operational procedures while accommodating to data privacy protection requirements.

### Distributed Storage
Distributed storage framework aims to break the limitations of single-machine resource and boost system capacity and performance. It separates computation and storage units with modularized data exchange API for better flexibility. This framework simplifies data management and accelerate business development flow by defining standard CURD adaptors for common databases like MySQL, and supporting widely-used Key-Value and SQL-like data tables.

### Parallel Transaction Processing
Parallel transaction processing engine effectively exploits multi-core computation resources to parallelize transaction processing. To address key performance bottleneck caused high frequency and high complexity computation, it provides pre-compiled framework to run C++-based smart contracts, which significantly boosts the efficiency of transaction execution.

### Developer Friendly
Entity Link Value Blockchainprovides various guides to compile and deploy blockchain instances, offering one-click deployment, speedy installation, and deployment on all mainstream platforms including Docker. It includes a comprehensive toolkit for speedy deployment, continuous monitoring, enterprise-level data governance, to save developersâ€™ valuable time from toil.
